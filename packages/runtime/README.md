# @openapi-io-ts/runtime

`openapi-io-ts` is a code generation tool capable of generating [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts) decoders from an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) document. It can also generate the code needed to perform the request and decode/parse the response returned by the server.

This package contains code used at runtime. See documentation at the project homepage.
